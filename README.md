I have previously worked with the following programmin languages:
 - C++
 - R
 - Octave
 - Matlab
 - LabVIEW
 - Python
 - Ruby
 - Java
 - C#
 - Lua
 - Ruby

At university I had at least one or more course of:
 - R
 - Java
 - Octave / Matlab

Notable university classes:
 - Descriptive statistics
 - - That focused on describing data and its main values like mean, media, skewness, standard deviation and others. All done in MS Excel
 - Statistics for engineers
 - - That included hipotesis testing on mean, variance and proportonality. It was mostly self learning but it inclduded function description for the choosed program. For me it was R. Also ANOVA testing for one population.
 - Mathematical statystics
 - - Same as above but it was explained where the formulas come from. It also included a proper R course.
 - Introduction to programming
 - - Done on Matlab because it is simple for beginners and because it has great mathematical power. We were introduced to some of it's major functions
 - Numerical methods
 - - Done in Matlab and Octave. This included algoritms to calculate derivatives, function interpolation, integral calculation and instability analysis.
 - Linear and square programming
 - - Also done in Octave and Matlab. The main focus was on the Simplex algorithm a simple one, one with the addition of a fake base and one including whole numbers as results. Problem modelling was at the base of it. It also included the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker theorem for square problems.
 - Programmin I and II
 - - Done in Java. Conditionals, loops, OOP, Exceptions, GUI creation, classes and other things you need to make basic command line programs.
 - Programming of computer based measuting systems
 - - The programming part was done in LabVIEW. It main focus was on the VISA programming commands and how to use them properly to make measurments.

Currently working on a Linux machine.
